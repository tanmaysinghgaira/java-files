Java Interface

An Interface in Java programming language is
 defined as an abstract type used to specify the
  behaviour of a class. An interface in Java is a 
  blueprint of a behaviour. A Java interface contains
   static
 constants and abstract methods.


 Key Properties of Interface:

The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
By default, variables in an interface are public, static and final.
It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
It supports loose coupling (classes depend on behavior, not implementation).
In other words, interfaces primarily define methods that other classes must implement.
An interface in Java defines a set of behaviours that a class can implement,
 usually representing a CAN-DO relationship,
 but not always in every scenario
